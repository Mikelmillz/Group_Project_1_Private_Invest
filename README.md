Geospatial Crime Rate Analysis

Project Description
This project aims to determine crime rate hotspots through geospatial analysis by identifying trends and correlations between crime hotspots and various factors such as unemployment rates and socioeconomic backgrounds. We intend to analyze the types of crimes committed and their locations, understanding the dynamics of crime within urban environments.

Research Questions
Geospatial Analysis of Crime Hotspots:
What happened to crime across the country?​​
What happened to specific types of crime?​​
What happened to differently populated areas?

Datasets
