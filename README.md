Geospatial Crime Rate Analysis

Project Description
This project aims to determine crime rate hotspots through geospatial analysis by identifying trends and correlations between crime hotspots and various factors such as unemployment rates and socioeconomic backgrounds. We intend to analyze the types of crimes committed and their locations, understanding the dynamics of crime within urban environments.

Research Questions
Geospatial Analysis of Crime Hotspots: Are there identifiable hotspots for certain types of crimes within a city, and how do these hotspots change over time, or during specific times of the day or week?
Correlation with Unemployment: Do these crime hotspots correlate with local unemployment rates?
Socioeconomic Factors: Do these crime hotspots correlate with the socioeconomic backgrounds of the areas?

Datasets
Crime Data API | CrimeoMeter: Access to detailed crime data and statistics.
Available APIs (census.gov): Socioeconomic datasets including employment rates.
